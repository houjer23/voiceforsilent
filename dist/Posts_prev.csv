From toasting with champagne in England to gathering for a feast in China, these celebrations each contain their own stories waiting to be explored. A Night of Fireworks and Celebrations in Different Cultures For Hana from England, New Year’s Eve is all about celebrating with friends and family. “We usually gather at home or a pub with snacks like crisps and sausage rolls,” she shares. As the clock nears midnight, all eyes turn to the dazzling fireworks display in London. “At midnight, we toast with champagne or prosecco and wish each other a happy new year,” she adds. Meanwhile, the Chinese Lunar New Year is a deeply rooted tradition in China. “It’s the biggest celebration for us,” says Angelica. “We clean the house to sweep away bad luck, put up red lanterns, and have a huge family dinner with fish and dumplings for prosperity.” The festival also brings the much-anticipated red envelopes (hongbao), filled with lucky money for children and unmarried relatives. In Korea, Seollal marks the Lunar New Year with many traditions. “We wear hanbok, perform a deep bow called sebae to our elders for blessings, and eat tteokguk (rice cake soup), which symbolizes aging another year,” Clara explains. Alongside family games like yutnori, they also honor ancestors through ceremonial rites known as charye. Silvester, also known as Germany’s New Year’s Eve, brings a mix of modern festivity and quirky traditions. “We melt small pieces of lead and interpret the shapes to predict the future—it’s actually pretty fun,” Lukas shares. Berliner Pfannkuchen (jam-filled doughnuts) are a must, along with watching Dinner for One, a British comedy sketch that has become a German New Year’s staple. Resolutions: A Fresh Start or a Fading Trend? As the excitement of the New Year fades, many people set resolutions. But are these resolutions really accomplished? “I’ve tried cutting down on takeaways or going to the gym more, but they usually fizzle out by February,” Hana admits. Angelica prefers setting intentions rather than rigid resolutions, while Clara believes they work if kept realistic: “Last year, I wanted to learn a new skill, so I took cooking classes—and it actually worked out!” Lukas takes a flexible approach: “I wanted to read more books, and I did manage to finish a few, so I’d call that a win.” Levin, on the other hand, hasn’t made resolutions but respects those who do: “I admire the dedication it takes to follow through.” Looking Back, Moving Forward The transition from one year to the next is also a time for reflection. “I started walking more in 2024. It’s a small thing, but I feel fitter,” says Hana. As she reflects on her past year, there is one habit she wants to leave behind. “Staying up too late scrolling on my phone.” For Angelica, the past year brought the discovery of meditation, thanks to her business teacher. “It helped me stay calm during stressful times,” she says, though she hopes to bid farewell to procrastination in 2025. Lukas found better organization through a study app but wants to stop skipping breakfast. Katie is focused on shifting away from external validation, while Emily treasures the friendships she made in 2024 but wants to curb her late-night TikTok habits. As Levin puts it, “One thing that worked was being around friends, it really boosted my mood. In 2025, I just want to leave behind procrastination and doomscrolling.” As the final moments of the year 2024 slip away, we realize that no matter where we are in the world, the New Year is a time of connection, reflection, and renewal. From grand fireworks displays over city skylines to quiet family gatherings steeped in tradition, each culture welcomes the coming year in its own meaningful way. Whether it’s the warmth of a shared meal, the excitement of age-old customs, or the hopeful promise of resolutions, these moments remind us that while our celebrations and culture may be different, the spirit behind them remains the same.",0,"en",2025-02-06T19:51:17Z,false,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""foo"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""As the clock strikes 12, another year begins. "",""decorations"":[{""type"":""COLOR"",""colorData"":{""background"":""transparent"",""foreground"":""rgb(0, 0, 0)""}}]}}],""paragraphData"":{}},{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""tffse65"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""efosq66"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""Across the world, people welcome the New Year in ways that reflect their culture, traditions, and personal hopes for the future.

Buenos Aires. Argentina. The world seemed to pause as the heartbreaking news of Liam Payne's death spread, sending a ripple of grief through the world. Fans, young and old, were struck with disbelief, grappling not just with the loss of a celebrity, but with the loss of someone who had been a part of our lives for so long. I’m sure we’ve all sat in front of the TV, completely mesmerized by him and his bandmates. We watched them grow, we sang their songs, and we believed they’d always be there.  From his early days as a heartthrob in One Direction to his struggles as a solo artist, Payne’s journey was one of triumphs and trials. But his death has made one thing painfully clear—it wasn’t just about the fame. It was the weight of it all, the relentless pressure, the mental toll, and the hidden struggles that come with being in the spotlight. Liam’s passing has peeled back the curtain on the darker side of fame and opened a necessary conversation about mental health in the music industry. The Dark Side of Stardom Liam’s life wasn’t all glamorous red carpets and chart-topping hits; beneath the surface, he grappled with personal demons—substance abuse, mental health struggles, and the relentless pressure of living up to the expectations of millions. His passing has peeled back the curtain on the hidden struggles of fame, opening the door to uncomfortable truths. A high school student, Emily reflected on how his death revealed the underlying truth about fame: ""It’s like the whole world is starting to understand that fame isn’t just fun and excitement. It takes a toll. It feels like people are realizing just how much artists need support.”  For Violet, a music coach who has spent years working with young artists, Liam’s death was a heartbreaking revelation. “You think about the joy he gave to people, his beautiful voice, his positivity. But then you realize… how much he must have been carrying. Fame comes with a price, and for Liam, it was too much to bear.” The Gaping Hole Left Behind By Fans The reaction to Liam's passing was one of profound disbelief, and many fans felt as if they had grown up with these artists who had first reached popularity in their teenage years. Mike, a 7th-grade student who grew up listening to One Direction, shared the emptiness he felt. “It’s like something significant is just gone. I can’t believe it. It’s like losing a part of my childhood.” For others, a classmate of our interviewer in Shenzhen China who has followed Liam’s career from the very beginning, the grief was tinged with questions of what could have been done differently. “It’s heartbreaking to think about the pressures he faced behind the scenes,” the classmate said. “Artists like Liam—so much talent, so much to give—just need better support. If only someone had intervened earlier and checked in with him more regularly. Maybe things would have turned out differently.” A Legacy As fans mourn the loss of the man who was once part of the biggest boy band in the world, they are also celebrating his legacy—not just as a member of One Direction, but as an artist who dared to carve his own path. His talent was undeniable, his voice unforgettable, but it was his vulnerability and resilience that left an indelible mark on the hearts of his fans. Ava, a high school sophomore, captured this sentiment perfectly. “Liam wasn’t just the pop star. He was real. He was honest about his struggles, and that made him relatable. We should remember him for that bravery, for being so open about his battles.” His evolution from the boy band heartthrob to a solo artist was a testament to his growth—not just as a musician, but as a human being. “Liam’s journey showed resilience, creativity, and the will to keep moving forward even when life threw him obstacles,” said a classmate of our interviewer. “That’s what we should honor—his passion, his ability to keep going, despite everything.” A Turning Point for the Industry Liam Payne’s death is no longer just about mourning the loss of a beloved celebrity. It has become a call for change within the music industry. Fans, advocates, and even professionals are demanding better mental health support; conversations that were once hushed behind closed doors are now being spoken about loudly and openly.  “I think people are finally starting to realize that fame doesn’t just come with perks,” Violet said. “It comes with pressure, with scrutiny, with constant evaluation. The conversation around mental health in the music industry has to change.” A growing movement, sparked by Liam’s passing, has led to the creation of a petition for ""Liam’s Law""—a policy that would ensure artists have mandatory mental health check-ups and access to professionals while on tour. With over 134,000 signatures already, the petition is gaining momentum, a clear sign that fans and the industry alike are calling for structural change. “We need to create a system that supports artists,” Emily said. “It’s not just about the music. It’s about the people behind it.”  As we reflect on Liam Payne's untimely death, we can’t help but feel a deep sense of loss—not just for the artist, but for the person we once were, sitting in front of the TV, dreaming big and looking up to him and his bandmates. To so many of us, he wasn’t just a pop star—he was a part of our childhoods, the voice behind our favorite songs, the person who helped us navigate our own growing pains. We idolized him, and his passing feels like losing a piece of that innocence for many. His struggles, hidden behind the glitz and glamour of fame, were the last thing we could have imagined when we sang along to his songs. But now, his death has ignited something more profound than just grief—it’s sparked a movement. It’s a call for change, for a world where artists aren’t just celebrated for their talents but are cared for as human beings. And maybe, just maybe, by speaking out, we can create the world we wish we had for him—one where the pressure of fame doesn’t overshadow the joy of music.",0,"en",2024-11-12T04:42:45Z,false,[],"{""nodes"":[{""type"":""PARAGRAPH"",""id"":""crv9c267"",""nodes"":[],""paragraphData"":{}},{""paragraphData"":{""textStyle"":{""textAlignment"":""AUTO""}},""style"":{},""id"":""t4z9a70"",""nodes"":[{""type"":""TEXT"",""id"":"""",""nodes"":[],""textData"":{""text"":""It was October 16, 2024.

Noah highlights the diverse narratives presented by different medias, where “it's interesting to see how different media outlets paint the picture” and how these portrayals of Democrats and Republicans influence the perspectives of those in Singapore. In exploring the transformative role of technology and social media have on global events such as the US election, Noah describes social media as a contemporary ""town square” where “everyone gathers to chat about global events. You get real-time reactions, memes, and debates. It's like a global conversation, and we're all part of it. It's crazy how tech has made the world feel so much smaller, and as a student, it's like having a front-row seat to a never-ending discussion about everything.” With the 2024 US presidential election approaching, it becomes evident that its ripple effects extend far beyond American borders, touching lives and shaping opinions across the globe. Each perspective serves as a reminder that in the interconnected world, the outcome of one nation's decision can influence global dynamics, shaping the future in ways both seen and unforeseen. Standing on the edge of this crucial moment in history, it's clear that the 2024 US election is not just an American affair but a global event, watched and interpreted through countless lenses, each adding depth to the complex narrative of time.

From international students to environmental scientists, and even businesses in China, Trump’s policies are reshaping the world. As countries brace for the implications of his re-election, many are wondering: What does this mean for trade, the environment, immigration, and future opportunities for the general public? We spoke to students from around the world to understand how Trump's policies might impact their futures; here’s what they had to say. What Does Trump’s Election Mean for Different Countries? For many outside of the US, Trump's presidency is tied directly to trade policies and international relations. “For China, we have to be extra cautious about what Trump plans to do,” said Molly Huang, an international student from the BISZ School in Shenzhen. “Right now, there’s no guarantee on what direction US China relations will take under his leadership.”She went on further expressing concerns over the unpredictable nature of Trump’s foreign policy, particularly as it relates to the ongoing tension between the two countries. Across the Pacific, Alicia, an environmental science student in China, raised a similar concern about trade and environmental policies specifically.  “If he goes through with imposing a 10% tariff on imports, it could significantly raise the cost of goods, hurting both businesses and consumers worldwide,” she explained. However, her biggest worry lies in Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. “It felt like the US was stepping away from its global responsibility to combat climate change,” Alicia said, feeling less optimistic about government-driven environmental initiatives and rethinking career goals because of the unpredictability of the job market.  For other students, like Justin Zhang from Hong Kong, Trump's policies are more directly tied to economics. ""Trump's talk of heavy tariffs on China during his campaign left me worried about the economic tension,"" he said. ""If he follows through, it might not be the best for China economically."" Yet, not all responses to Trump’s election are fraught with concern. “I think his statement that China and America together can conquer the world hints at a more positive relationship between the two countries,” said Molly, offering a hopeful perspective on the diplomatic future. Still, the question remains: What’s next? Which Policies Stood Out? While opinions vary, Trump’s stance on immigration and tariffs are two policies that have caught attention far and wide. For international students, Trump’s stance on immigration and visa policies remains a key concern. An anonymous student currently studying in the US expressed concerns about the impact on education, noting, “I’ve heard that under Trump, it became harder for international students to study in the US. This uncertainty in visa policies affects students. ” However, not all policies are met with skepticism. An anonymous student from Shenzhen expressed hope regarding Trump’s plan to issue green cards to graduates of US universities. “If this policy goes through, it could provide an opportunity for international students to stay and contribute to the US economy after graduation,” they said.  Another significant policy that has gained traction is Trump’s promise to end wars within 24 hours of being elected. ""He believes that by using his negotiation skills, he can stop conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war. While some doubt his ability to achieve peace this quickly, the promise of a rapid resolution caught my attention,"" an anonymous source from Shenzhen noted. With all these different perspectives, we can clearly see the concerns and hopes on immigration from students across the globe. The Trump Effect on Careers When asked about how Trump’s policies affect careers, several respondents highlighted the uncertainty surrounding student life, particularly for international students and professionals looking to stay in the US.  “Trump’s policies create a lot of uncertainty for students like me who plan to study in the US,” said Molly Huang. “The unpredictability of immigration and visa policies could determine where I end up studying, and even where I go after graduation.” For international students, navigating the shifting immigration policies has become a critical concern, with many unsure about their ability to remain in the US long-term. Many share similar sentiments, with responses such as ""Trump’s policies could affect my future in the US,"" and ""His immigration policies may impact my ability to stay or work in the U.S. after graduation."" However, an anonymous student also noted the silver lining to this situation, with Trump’s plan to offer green cards to all students graduating from US colleges. For Alicia, Trump’s approach to climate change left her rethinking her career goals. “With deregulation and withdrawal from international agreements, I felt less hopeful about working in the environmental sector,” she said. “But maybe this is an opportunity for private initiatives and innovation in the field — the job market is definitely unpredictable right now.” On the flip side, economic policies, such as Trump’s focus on reducing inflation, are seen as potential opportunities.  “Trump’s focus on reducing inflation could help stabilize the US economy in the long run, and therefore, benefit students like me,” he said. “If the economy becomes more predictable, it could benefit students and professionals alike, especially those looking to build careers in the US.” In the end, opinions vary, but one thing remains clear: Trump’s policies are not just shaping American lives but are also having a profound effect on global students, professionals, and businesses. From tariffs to green card promises, Trump’s second term looks to be a whirlwind of change, pushing many to reconsider their futures and careers. The World Next Step: Watch and Adjust As the world watches, there is no doubt that Trump’s election has sparked a ripple effect in global tension, adaptation, and potential. Whether it’s navigating the complexities of immigration, grappling with trade wars, or rethinking environmental strategies, the consequences of his presidency will be felt far beyond the borders of America.  As the next four years unfold, the world waits in anticipation. While the future remains uncertain, one thing is certain: the ability to adapt will be crucial.

Varying opinions emerged from a range of individuals across the globe, each reflecting on the candidates’ performances, policies, and debate strategies. From students in the U.S. to international observers in Singapore, the debate was analyzed through different lenses. Here's a glimpse into the public's reaction, based on interviews conducted post-debate. Who won in public opinion？ Many viewers felt Kamala Harris held her own, delivering a strong, composed performance. Katherine, a student in the U.S., remarked, ""I think Kamala won the debate. She had more clear responses to Trump’s claims and had some kind of plan."" For Katherine, a student in the US, Harris’s clarity and structured responses outweighed Trump's approach, which she felt were off-topic at times. Alice, a Year 13 student from Singapore, shared a similar statement, noting that Harris ""was more focused on presenting solutions, and her demeanor felt more presidential."" Others, however, saw Trump’s assertiveness as a strength. Lydia, a US student, described the debate as ""pretty evenly matched,"" though she admitted that ""Trump edged out"" with his confidence. An anonymous student from Hong Kong also leaned toward Trump, praising his ability to ""defend his side very well"" and pressure Harris during key moments. Ultimately, opinions on the winner often align with the viewers' pre-existing political preferences. While some preferred the coolness of Harris, others felt inspired by the aggressiveness and passion displayed by Trump.  Appealing Ideas One of the key points of division between the candidates was their stance on social and economic issues, including abortion, education, and climate change. For Sarah, a Year 11 student from Singapore, Harris’s focus on women’s rights resonated deeply. ""As a young woman, I feel strongly about these issues,"" she said. Harris’s positions on these topics convinced Sarah that the Vice President ""would actually do something."" Similarly, Ben, another Singaporean student, connected with Harris’s emphasis on improving education. ""Her focus on making education more accessible to underserved communities stood out,"" he explained. For Ben, this issue hit close to home, especially as someone who had witnessed disparities in educational systems across different countries. While Harris found strong support on social issues, Trump’s economic plans appealed to others. An anonymous student from the U.S. appreciated Harris’s stance on abortion but found Trump's economic ideas compelling. They mentioned that Trump’s plans seemed ""more practical"" when addressing the nation’s current economic challenges. Changing Perspectives Though the debate energized political discussions, it didn’t necessarily shift opinions for many viewers. Katherine admitted, ""Overall, I don't think the debate significantly changed my opinion."" Her sentiments were shared by several others who found the candidates' performances reinforcing their prior beliefs rather than reevaluation. However, the debate did spark evolved perspectives; Ben, who initially doubted Harris’s ability to stand up to Trump, acknowledged that she ""showed a lot of resilience and intelligence"" during the debate. Alice also found herself leaning more toward Harris after seeing her calm composure compared to Trump, though she maintained reservations. Conversely, Lydia mentioned a slight shift in her views of Trump, stating that while she had concerns about his policies, ""some of the points he made made me reconsider his leadership role."" As the election draws closer, the debate provided voters with more material to consider, but whether it changed the political landscape remains to be seen. We encourage all who are eligible to register and vote.

However, as these platforms grow in influence, concerns about their potential harms, such as the spread of misinformation and the balance between free speech and online regulations, also rise. This article explores how individuals from around the world perceive the impact of social media as it becomes an integral part of daily life and addresses the critical question: Do you think there should be limitations and oversight on social media? Take a look into how these citizens from around the world perceive the influence of social media as they penetrate daily life.  As a student from Canada, Angelina sees social media as a “double-sided blade,” where it has made her more active in building connections online, but sometimes she feels that she is more focused on her online persona than her real self. This sentiment is shared by many others who find themselves falling into the addiction of online interactions and losing track of time on these platforms.  Julia, a student from China who adds on the point previously expressed by Angelina when asked about her take on these platforms. ""YouTube is my go-to for entertainment and learning, but I can spend hours watching videos. Instagram, meanwhile, keeps me glued with endless reels,"" she confesses.  Elena, from the United States, shares this struggle regarding her productivity. ""Social media helps me stay connected, but it's also a major distraction. Platforms like TikTok can be addictive, impacting my productivity,"" she admits. Eileen, another student in Canada, overlooks these struggles and delves into the more heavily debated issues of social media and its misinformation when interviewed. ""Letting misinformation spread unchecked is dangerous, even if it's seen as a violation of free speech. Some regulation is necessary to prevent harm,"" she argues.  Sofia, from China, was a buttress to Eileen’s opinion, as she brings attention to the need for boundaries in the digital space. ""It's crucial to prevent harm from spreading misinformation, even if it means some limits on free speech. Words can hurt, and social media makes it easy,"" she notes.  These diverse perspectives reveal a complex relationship regarding social media. While it fosters connectivity and convenience, concerns about its addictive nature, productivity impact, and the unchecked spread of misinformation can still be persistent drawbacks. Due to the different voices, The global debate on implementing regulatory measures to mitigate these risks without infringing on free expression continues to intensify, where policy makers struggle to find a thin line of balance.  However, achieving this seemingly impossible task is not without hope. From the examples of various international countries, there are measures that can alleviate these struggles. For instance, Germany's Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG) mandates the removal of illegal content such as hate speech on social media within 24 hours of notification. This regulation has proven effective, reducing the intensity of hate speech in Germany by 2 percent and decreasing the volume of original hateful tweets by 11%. Similarly, the UK's Online Harms White Paper proposes an obligatory duty of care for online platforms, requiring them to take actionable steps to protect users from harmful content. By balancing regulatory oversight with the flexibility for platforms to develop their own policies, it is possible to preserve democratic values while also reducing online harm. As societies continue to contend with these issues, the challenge lies in finding a balance where the benefits of social media can be maximized and its potential harms are minimized. Only when everyone feels safe from the deteriorating factors of social media, we are truly free. And by that, we work towards finding that sliver of balance to preserve a thriving and pluralistic democratic society where all voices can be heard.  References:

Stemming from 776 BC, the Olympics always stood as a symbol of global unity, however, tensions between countries were impossible to ignore this year.

Beyond the controversy, the 2024 Paris Olympics have had an undeniably positive impact on communities around the world.

In a quiet corner of the world, nestled in the safety of Singapore, an international school community is breaking the silence surrounding the devastating Israel-Palestine conflict. Despite being miles away from the war-torn territory, their voice carries the weight of empathy and a passionate desire for change.  The Israel-Palestine conflict, deeply rooted in historical and territorial disputes, centers around the struggle for the equal division of the region. Emerging in the late 19th century, the movement gained momentum with the Zionist aspiration for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. This led to tensions between Jewish and Arab communities, with both Israelis and Palestinians asserting historical claims to the land. Over the decades, the ongoing strife has led to displacement, loss of lives, and enduring hardship for both communities.  As the world watches, a group of students and teachers in Singapore share their insight into the question “How is the war affecting children from the warring countries”? Upon reflection, student C paints a stark picture of the victimized children, where they are “stripped of any sense of normality or any sense of safety in a safe environment”. I, another student, speak about the longstanding struggle of Palestinian children. The vivid recounting of a video, where a child witnessed “their cousin being bombed behind them”, adds a chilling layer to the narrative. Teacher M takes a deeper exploration of this question, underscoring the underlying consequences, leaving lasting physical and mental trauma. The impact on education, often overlooked, is emphasized, where the children “will be behind their peers and won’t be able to have the happy childhood that children should have”. In the midst of their reflections, the interviewees were asked to “share their thoughts on how the school community in Singapore can contribute to raising awareness”.  All interviewed students, although having different specific approaches, collectively plead for a proactive stance from the school community, urging decision-makers to step up and address global issues in the curriculum. Teacher M calls for a different approach, where M stresses the importance of “ fact-checking before they are discussing things, and they truly know what’s going on”.  Although the distance is a physical barrier for them to offer support, this does not hinder the interviewees from doing their part and offers suggestions for students who want to support those affected by the conflict. Student C encourages self-education first and “supporting charities, and people who would help anyone in Palestine, and maybe refugees”. Student I urges more proactive measures such as online activism,  continuing to “make noise about this situation (as) it’s kind of died out”. Teacher M suggests helping out with charity organizations, ranging from donating money to collecting goods. R calls for a shift in the school approach, where lessons should be dedicated to educating students on ongoing conflict. R argued the importance of providing a “stepping stone for students to begin to want to educate themselves, (...) cause we can’t just change how our society works entirely. We have to start somewhere, and eventually, these students grow up, they graduate the school, they might be able to spread their knowledge, so the more people can know what’s happening”.   The words of these in Singapore transcend beyond the geographical boundaries, bridging the gap between their safe haven and the war-torn lands.
